# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 12, 2022
##### Mastering in JavaScript

**Today's Progress**: remembered JSES6 features and made a plan to use them productively. Made 12 class in fcc about basic algorithm scripts and finished basic algorithm scripts course.

**Thoughts:** It is really upsetting that we can easily forget if we don't use what we've learned. Since I was dealing with also UI/UX, I realized that I started to forget frontend and it made me anxious. I didn't want to pick a side among frontend and uÄ±/uc but it is so hard to keep up with both of them. I feel like I didn't progress at all since I'm graduated. But I also know that I will fix this up.

### Day 2: December 13, 2022
##### Mastering in JavaScript

**Today's Progress**: finished half of the oop in fcc productively

**Thoughts:** Today i realized again that consistency is the key and it can't be done by watching others or reading documentation in coding field. I was also feeling sad because i was not like the others in programming, i was a slow learner in this field and tried to keep up with their learning style. But I'm a visual/experimental learner, i know this so i thought why would i try to fit and do what everybody does, visualization has a huge part in my learning so i started creating cards for methods or for functionalities. Also im having some focusing problems so i divided 1 hour to 20 mins with 5 min breaks. Imma be succesfull, i just need to focus the current moment, not the future.

### Day 3: December 14, 2022
##### Mastering in JavaScript

**Today's Progress**: finished oop and started functional programming in fcc, learned IIFE, remembered mixins, realized what i forgot

**Thoughts:** Back then I mostly needed some hint to find solutions but now after doing every part without rush, I finally realized that I can do it :) This imposter syndrome really sucks sometimes. Also I noticed that I often get anxious about my future lately but I suddenly looked up to the sky and there was blue trying to show up behind all the grey clouds so it reminded me that sadness or happiness, none of them will stay forever. I won't be unemployed forever, I won't be the last person in the race forever. So I just need to keep trying to do the best!!

### Day 4: December 15, 2022
##### Mastering in JavaScript

**Today's Progress**: i suppose i wrote my first independent filter and map functions today without anyones help, i really feel like im understanding and i can also see that, im remembering constantly

**Thoughts:** seeing that i can do stuff without anyones help or without racing anyone is giving me confidence and i also can see success now. i still need a better time managing skills tho. i finally started to feel like i deserve to work as a frontend dev. nothing heals imposter syndrome more than courage and try.

### Day 5: December 16, 2022
##### Mastering in JavaScript

**Today's Progress**: i learned math.pow and passed 3 more parts in fcc

**Thoughts:** i was feeling bad for the whole day, i didn't wanted to do something but at the same time i didn't enjoy doing nothing and like this is not enough guests came over, it's midnight and they are still in the house with their noisy kids. i can't focus but i won't left it here. i will continue to do visualizing methods now, doing nothing is worse than failing.
