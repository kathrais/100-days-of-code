# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 12, 2022
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: remembered JSES6 features and made a plan to use them productively. Made 12 class in fcc about basic algorithm scripts and finished basic algorithm scripts course.

**Thoughts:** It is really upsetting that we can easily forget if we don't use what we've learned. Since I was dealing with also UI/UX, I realized that I started to forget frontend and it made me anxious. I didn't want to pick a side among frontend and uÄ±/uc but it is so hard to keep up with both of them. I feel like I didn't progress at all since I'm graduated. But I also know that I will fix this up.
