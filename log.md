# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 12, 2022
##### Mastering in JavaScript

**Today's Progress**: remembered JSES6 features and made a plan to use them productively. Made 12 class in fcc about basic algorithm scripts and finished basic algorithm scripts course.

**Thoughts:** It is really upsetting that we can easily forget if we don't use what we've learned. Since I was dealing with also UI/UX, I realized that I started to forget frontend and it made me anxious. I didn't want to pick a side among frontend and uÄ±/uc but it is so hard to keep up with both of them. I feel like I didn't progress at all since I'm graduated. But I also know that I will fix this up.

### Day 2: December 13, 2022
##### Mastering in JavaScript

**Today's Progress**: finished half of the oop in fcc productively

**Thoughts:** Today i realized again that consistency is the key and it can't be done by watching others or reading documentation in coding field. I was also feeling sad because i was not like the others in programming, i was a slow learner in this field and tried to keep up with their learning style. But I'm a visual/experimental learner, i know this so i thought why would i try to fit and do what everybody does, visualization has a huge part in my learning so i started creating cards for methods or for functionalities. Also im having some focusing problems so i divided 1 hour to 20 mins with 5 min breaks. Imma be succesfull, i just need to focus the current moment, not the future.
