# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 12, 2022
##### Mastering in JavaScript

**Today's Progress**: remembered JSES6 features and made a plan to use them productively. Made 12 class in fcc about basic algorithm scripts and finished basic algorithm scripts course.

**Thoughts:** It is really upsetting that we can easily forget if we don't use what we've learned. Since I was dealing with also UI/UX, I realized that I started to forget frontend and it made me anxious. I didn't want to pick a side among frontend and uÄ±/uc but it is so hard to keep up with both of them. I feel like I didn't progress at all since I'm graduated. But I also know that I will fix this up.

### Day 2: December 13, 2022
##### Mastering in JavaScript

**Today's Progress**: finished half of the oop in fcc productively

**Thoughts:** Today i realized again that consistency is the key and it can't be done by watching others or reading documentation in coding field. I was also feeling sad because i was not like the others in programming, i was a slow learner in this field and tried to keep up with their learning style. But I'm a visual/experimental learner, i know this so i thought why would i try to fit and do what everybody does, visualization has a huge part in my learning so i started creating cards for methods or for functionalities. Also im having some focusing problems so i divided 1 hour to 20 mins with 5 min breaks. Imma be succesfull, i just need to focus the current moment, not the future.

### Day 3: December 14, 2022
##### Mastering in JavaScript

**Today's Progress**: finished oop and started functional programming in fcc, learned IIFE, remembered mixins, realized what i forgot

**Thoughts:** Back then I mostly needed some hint to find solutions but now after doing every part without rush, I finally realized that I can do it :) This imposter syndrome really sucks sometimes. Also I noticed that I often get anxious about my future lately but I suddenly looked up to the sky and there was blue trying to show up behind all the grey clouds so it reminded me that sadness or happiness, none of them will stay forever. I won't be unemployed forever, I won't be the last person in the race forever. So I just need to keep trying to do the best!!

### Day 4: December 15, 2022
##### Mastering in JavaScript

**Today's Progress**: i suppose i wrote my first independent filter and map functions today without anyones help, i really feel like im understanding and i can also see that, im remembering constantly

**Thoughts:** seeing that i can do stuff without anyones help or without racing anyone is giving me confidence and i also can see success now. i still need a better time managing skills tho. i finally started to feel like i deserve to work as a frontend dev. nothing heals imposter syndrome more than courage and try.

### Day 5: December 16, 2022
##### Mastering in JavaScript

**Today's Progress**: i learned math.pow and passed 3 more parts in fcc

**Thoughts:** i was feeling bad for the whole day, i didn't wanted to do something but at the same time i didn't enjoy doing nothing and like this is not enough guests came over, it's midnight and they are still in the house with their noisy kids. i can't focus but i won't left it here. i will continue to do visualizing methods now, doing nothing is worse than failing.

### Day 6: December 17, 2022
##### Mastering in Programming

**Today's Progress**: learned crity curry, used what ive learned beforehand, finished functional programming in fcc, did 3 more visual js cards

**Thoughts:** internet went off from my 7 year old needs an update computer so i couldn't do much. also i feel lazy these days.

### Day 7: December 18, 2022
##### Mastering in Programming

**Today's Progress**: finished 6 part egex in fcc and did that with w3 documentary support and created 4 visual regex cards

**Thoughts:** i finally feel like hardworker and clever again :D weather affects too much...i really enjoyed working today didn't look at the time and i will continue to work. seeing that i finally can remember faster, write code faster, check documentary little is making me so happy.

### Day 8: December 19, 2022
##### Mastering in Programming

**Today's Progress**: relearned math.max, math.min but this time i understood its usage more and created colorful cards for them. im stuck with reduce till i understand it.

**Thoughts:** i realized that i was doing everything for it to be "done", without understanding it deeply. i couldn't even give an answer back than so i waas always silent. but now i finally learn. today i stuck with reduce. i couldn't understand it before and i can't understand it now but i know it is usefull and i don't want to give up from learning it even if i will never use it. so basically my 1 hour spend on with this problem *****Return the sum of those two numbers plus the sum of all the numbers between them. The lowest number will not always come first.***** and understanding it.

### Day 9: December 20, 2022
##### Mastering in Programming

**Today's Progress**: understood and used .call() and .reduce() focused on pseudocode steps, passed 2 parts in fcc

**Thoughts:** i worked 50mins today. i want to work on design these days and i also have internet connection problems so it creates procrastination and anger and anxiety. im sick of being unorganized im sick of sleeping im sick of waking up late or if i woke up earyly im sick of feeling sleepy all day. im sick of being unemployed. i want to earn money with my skills. my future is so blurry even ai can write code these days. im sick of it im sick of all of it im sick of from everything. it is so hard to keep trying. it is so hard.

### Day 10: December 21, 2022
##### Mastering in Programming

**Today's Progress**: sending the daily tweet

**Thoughts:** did nothing. im feeling sad, depressed, overwhelmed, annoyed. i have internet issues its cutting off randomly, my laptop is old af. i dont have any money to do something.



### Day 11: December 22, 2022
##### Mastering in Programming

**Today's Progress**: remembered destructiring, the rest operator, scope, global and local variables

**Thoughts:** i didn't worked whole 1 hour but i did worked on js es6. it was great to do because i understood now. i really need to do these remembering stuff more often because if i work on some project they all almost have the same skills. these days everbody focuses on cheap succes so they want you to do fast stuff so you cant focus on productivity. such a shame. but programming is fun. these days ive been feeling sad and depressed because all of my friends almost got the jobs but im still unemployed and i cant still find a customer. it is really overwhelming. and they all telling me that how they admire me, they wish they have the courage like me and stuff and its just sounds fake.

### Day 12: December 23, 2022
##### Mastering in Programming

**Today's Progress**: made dinner and breakfast, did laundry, did cake and other stuff, washed the dishes, took my brother from home to school and school to home

**Thoughts:** i think im having some exam thing from god because these days has been so hard for me. housework is taking too much time and i even forgot myself. i feel lonely and it does not like a strange feeling. i feel like im getting weaker and weaker everyday.



### Day 13: December 24, 2022
##### Mastering in Programming

**Today's Progress**: remembered class functions, getters and setters, import export scripts, promises

**Thoughts:** today i felt like sun kissed my cheek and there was a song that made everything silent and it made me happy. i know i don't have to be fast, i know i try my best but somehow sometimes i feel like all of this are worthless. im guessing its because of my environment. oh and i bought a new keyboard and i dont know how did i survive this long without rgb keyboard :) today i finally fully understand js promises and did almost all the things without getting a hint. and when i need a hint at least i know which methods can be used :) i still feel tired and lonely and maybe hopeless but i know even monssoon rains stops for a while and it also causes so many different and durable species :)))) i even enjoy being sad because living is so exciting.

### Day 14: December 25, 2022
##### Mastering in Programming

**Today's Progress**: did some stuff with regex, getting used to use es6 more, started to figure it out the steps while coding

**Thoughts:** im getting tired everyday till 10pm and it is very hard to keep going like this but i also enjoy the ride :) im feeling more and more confident about programming, maybe i jump on python soon. knowing that i try my best to achieve my dream even in fckd up situations is giving me the feel of fullfilment. in addition to ride, i also started to enjoy programming. my fears are getting weaker because of trying everyday. i feel like my brain is stopped the defense mechanism and started to getting used to and be better at the situations that im facing because of my dedication and consistency and its making me proud.

### Day 16: December 27, 2022
##### Mastering in Programming

**Today's Progress**: learned substring method and its usage is similar to slice, replace method, learned that split("") splits by character and split(" ") splits by word, for the first time i saw charcodeat() and fromcharcode() methods 

**Thoughts:** today was kinda hard to understand. i couldn't follow up much but i tried my best. the best thing is now i dont feel insecure about my skills in programming anymore because i know it develops with trying and studying so i don't feel bad at all.
